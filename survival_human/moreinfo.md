## Human survivorship curves

#### USA cohort data from [The Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/)

Human survivorship is an example of **Type I** survivorship curve: mortality increases as we age.

However, from the data we well see a small twist. Mortality is quite high between age 0 and 1. We can also see that new-born mortality reduced over the years.
